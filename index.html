Signing up:

<ul>
<li>1) You need to signup at <a href="http://www.github.com">github.com</a>.</li>
<li>2) Once you've signed up, please downlod the github Mac app from <a href="http://mac.github.com">mac.github.com</a> and install it.</li>
<li>3) Once the app is installed, please open it and login to your github account by going to <b>GitHub</b> > Preferences > Accounts. You should be logged in immediately.</li>
<li>4) Now go back to your browser and head to <a href="https://github.com/engagementgamelab/">github.com/engagementgamelab</a>. This is where all of our repositories live.<br />- (In the video below, I am going to clone Test-Repository, but you'll want to go to the one you'd like to download to your Mac.)</li>
<li>5) Once you go to the repository you'd like to download, you'll see a button in the lower-right that says "Clone in Desktop". Click it and you'll be asked to launch the Mac app.</li>
<li>6) Nice! The Mac app has opened and is all set to "clone" (download) the repository. Once you hit Clone, the app will ask where you want the project to live. I recommend <i>Documents > Projects</i>. You'll then see the progress of the cloning.</li>
<li>7) Once the clone is done, you're going to be taken to the Changes tab of the repository. This, as the name suggests, is a list that tracks any changes you make to the project. So, if I add or change an image, some text, code, or anything else, Git is going to show it as ready for <b><i>commit</i></b>. By committing, you basically tell the repository that something in the project is different and/or new, and it's added to the history.</li>
<li>8) Whenever you commit, you must provide a summary and description of your changes. I recommend committing often, so that the description can be concise and you'll more easily be able to revert small changes if something goes wrong. There is no limit to how many commits you can make.</li>
<li>9) Ok, so now maybe you've made some commits, but they're currently local to your Mac. We need to tell github about the changes you've made. We do that by hitting Sync in the top-right of the app. This sends all your changes to our central repo in the cloud, so that other people can see them. Any syncs you make will show up in our #github channel on Slack, which you should log into right now (*shakes fist*).</li>

</ul>
